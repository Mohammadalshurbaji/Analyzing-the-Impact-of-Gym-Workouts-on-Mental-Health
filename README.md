# Mind Over Muscle: Analyzing the Impact of Gym Workouts on Mental Health

This project aims to uncover insights into the relationship between **gym workout habits** and **mental health** using data science and machine learning techniques. By collecting real-world data from diverse populations, the project seeks to quantify how physical activity impacts emotional well-being across different lifestyles.

>  **Note**: This project is currently under active development and is a work in progress.

## Project Objectives

- Explore correlations between exercise frequency/intensity and mental health indicators.
- Collect and clean real-world survey data from a diverse population.
- Build an end-to-end data science pipeline: from data preprocessing to ML and DL model deployment.
- Provide visual and statistical insights that may help inform healthier habits and public discussions on fitness and mental wellness.

## Step 1: Data Collection & Observation

To build this project from the ground up, we started by designing a survey to gather firsthand data. A **Google Form** was created and shared across:

- **LinkedIn**: Reaching professionals, students, and retirees.
- **Clemson University**: Distributed among students and faculty members to ensure demographic and lifestyle variety.

The survey includes questions about:

- Workout frequency and type  
- Sleep and diet habits  
- Stress, anxiety, and mental health indicators  
- Occupation/student status and lifestyle
